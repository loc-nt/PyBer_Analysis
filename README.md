# CHALLENGE:

The summary dataframe shows us the PyBer infomation based on city types. The Urban cities have the highest total rides and total drivers, and generate the highest fare among all three city types. However, the average fare per ride and per driver in these cities type are the lowest. On the other hand, despite being the lowest in all the totals, Rural cities have the highest average fare per ride and driver. That left the Suburban cities to have both totals and averages in the middle rank. Interestingly, the Rural cities revenue is equal to only 10% of the Urban revenue, while the Suburban cities revenue is about 50% of the Urban revenue. We can analyse more on this infomation using the lines chart.

The lines chart shows weekly total fares by city types in the first four months of 2019. Clearly, the Urban cities (yellow) stays on top, followed by Suburban (red), and Rural (blue) is at the bottom. The Urban line stays consistantly on the range $2,000-$2,500; the Suburban line is on the range about $800-$1,400; and the Rural line is always below $500.

Based on the two analysis above, it implies that the Urban and Suburban are the better markets for PyBer to focus on. Even though the average fare may be lower, those cities attract significantly more drivers and have more rides booked than Rural cities. The fares that they contribute are also clearly higher, thus more profitable. The lines chart also strengthens the fact that the gap between the markets are big, and the trend seems pretty steady and stable throughout the months. Therefore, PyBer should invest most of its resources to these two markets to maintain its current sustainable performance.
